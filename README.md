# next-web-starter

### Bootstrap your next web application and make your development process faster.

### Necessary knowledge to use this package

- React.js / Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

This repo was created to accelerate web development by providing all the basic setup for a project built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, including basic components (navbar, footer) and pages (homepage, contact), as well as basic styling. Take it as a skeleton for a basic website so you can save yourself hours of work setting up a project.

All you need to do is to clone the repo.

It will clone an entire Next.js app with all the configuration done for you, including files and folders.

Navigate to the newly created app folder and then run:

```
npm install
```

You can then run the app using

```
npm run dev
```

It will lauch the app on your local server (usually localhost:3000)

## Content of the repo:

The repo includes the whole setup for a basic app, all folders and mandatory files have been created for you. All you have to do is add your own content, modify styling and adjust the UI as you wish. The Navbar is fully responsive.

Here is how the app is structured, note that I chose not to use a /src folder, pages go under sub-folders located directly in the /app folder:
